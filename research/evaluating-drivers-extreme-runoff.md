            <b>Overview</b>
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: normal" class="m-0 pb-1"><small>Droughts and floods are two of the most common and widespread natural disasters, each affecting more than 70 million people globally per year - more than any other natural hazard. While these <i>hydroclimatic extremes</i> have always posed challenges for society, climate change is now exacerbating the frequency and intensity of these events across the globe, and both wet and dry extreme events are very likely to get worse with additional global warming.</small></p>
        <p style="line-height: normal" class="m-0 pb-1"><small>There remain significant uncertainties around hydroclimatic extremes and how they are changing on regional and local scales, which presents major obstacles for climate risk management and adaptation. Multiple challenges make it difficult to study and predict hydroclimatic extremes. One challenge is the lack of historical global-scale observations of variables like streamflow. Indeed, in large regions of the world, such as much of Africa, Central America, and Asia, the vast majority of streams remain ungauged. Without historical observations it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantitatively assess whether floods and streamflow droughts have been changing over time.</small></p>
        <p style="line-height: normal" class="m-0 pb-1"><small>Despite gaps in our understanding of how hydroclimatic extremes will respond to climate change, we have more confidence that many underlying hydroclimatic drivers are changing. For example, with increasing atmospheric temperature, the saturation vapor pressure of the atmosphere increases, leading to approximately a 7% increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere for every 1°C increase in atmospheric temperature. </small></p>
        <p style="line-height: normal" class="m-0 pb-1"><small>A key unanswered question in hydrologic science is how simultaneous, complex climate changes will collectively affect hydroclimatic extremes in different regions.</small></p>

        <p style="line-height: normal" class="m-0 pb-1"><small>Our research group is dedicated to utilizing cutting-edge technology and innovative methodologies to enhance our understanding of hydroclimatic extremes, specifically focusing on floods and droughts on a global scale. By harnessing the power of SWOT observations and data-driven models, we aim to unravel the complex interactions between climate processes and extreme hydrological events.</small></p>
        <p style="line-height: normal" class="m-0 pb-1"><small>Through a multi-faceted approach, our team is delving into the intricate relationships between various climatic factors such as precipitation patterns, snow cover dynamics, soil moisture levels, atmospheric temperature changes, and evapotranspiration rates. By analyzing these components, we seek to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving hydroclimatic extremes and their responses to a changing climate landscape.</small></p>
        <p style="line-height: normal" class="m-0 pb-1"><small>Our project is structured around four key activities: acquiring and processing meteorological and hydrological datasets, developing data-driven models of hydroclimatic processes using advanced regression and machine learning techniques, quantifying empirical hydrologic relationships at a global scale, and analyzing future changes in hydroclimatic drivers to project future extreme events.</small></p>
        <p style="line-height: normal" class="m-0 pb-1"><small>With a focus on producing new regression and machine learning models based on SWOT observations, our deliverables will include valuable insights into the empirical relationships between river discharge and hydroclimatic drivers, as well as assessments of future changes in floods and droughts based on enhanced process understanding.</small></p>
