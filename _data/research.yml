  questions:
   - q: "How does climate change affect the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation?"
     description: "There is evidence that global warming is increasing the occurrence of extreme precipitation in regions such as the U.S. Midwest. However, there are still questions about the relative influence of <i>dynamic changes</i> (those originating from changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation) and <i>thermodynamic changes </i> (those driven by increasing atmospheric temperatures). In this research, I am using machine learning to help answer this question. <br/><br/>I have trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify days with large-scale circulation patterns that are linked to extreme precipitation. Our research shows there has been a significant increase in the frequency of these extreme precipitation-associated circulation patterns over the past 20 years. Additionally, there have been significant increases in Midwest precipitation intensity when these circulation patterns occur. In other words, this research shows that both dynamic and thermodynamic changes have contributed to the recent increases in Midwest extreme precipitation. 

More broadly, this research demonstrates how deep learning and AI can be incredibly useful tools to help scientists understand climate change. My current research involves further developing these approaches to study other regions, and to study other events, like extreme heat."

  questions:
   - q: How have increases in precipitation affected the cost of flood damages in the United States?  
     description: "In this project, we analyze historical records of flood damage and precipitation in the U.S. over the recent past (1988-2017). Based on our statistical models, we estimate that increases in precipitation in the U.S. have caused about one third (or around $73 billion) of the recent flood damages. Although there are a number of factors that could lead to increased precipitation, human-caused climate change has likely contributed to these additional costs."
   - q: Why is this important? 
     description: "Flooding is one of the most common natural hazards - many people have personally experienced flooding and the damages it causes. Our research shows that climate change is making these costs worse. It is critical to consider these costs (and how they might be avoided in the future) when discussing possible climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies. This type of research provides essential information to policy makers who are evaluating benefits and costs of climate action."

  questions:
   - q: How does flooding in mountainous regions change when winter precipitation falls as rain instead of snow? 
     description: "Our research found that the largest rain-driven floods are >2.5 times the size of the largest snowmelt-driven floods. In fact, we found an approximately exponential relationship between the size of a flood and the fraction of rain contributing to the flood. In other words, a shift from snow to rain typically results in larger floods."
   - q: What are the future implications? 
     description: "This research suggests that in a warmer climate, most watersheds could experience increases in winter flood risk if a higher percentage of precipitation falls as rain. Our results indicates this is especially true for watersheds that have historically had a mixture of both snow and rain. These changes in flood size could occur even if the amount of precipitation doesn't change."
   - q: How did we answer these questions?
     description: "We analyzed daily streamflow data from 410 USGS stream gages across the Western U.S. using a panel regression. Panel regression analysis is a common econometric method that has only recently been applied to hydrology. This method allows us to to estimate the relationship between snow fraction and flood size across a large number of watersheds, while controlling for differences between watersheds that affect flooding (such as drainage area, topography, vegetation, etc.). Panel regression is really useful tool to understand how hydrology responds to changes in climate."
