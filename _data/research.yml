  short-desc: "This research demonstrates how deep learning and AI can be incredibly useful tools to help scientists understand climate change. My current research involves further developing these approaches to study other regions, and to study other events, like extreme heat."
  caption: "500 millibar geopotential height anomalies on June 8, 1993, a day with heavy precipitation over the Midwest region. Precipitation during June and July 1993 caused major flooding over the Midwest."

  questions:
   - q: "How does climate change affect the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation?"
     a: "There is evidence that global warming is increasing the occurrence of extreme precipitation in regions such as the U.S. Midwest. However, there are still questions about the relative influence of <i>dynamic changes</i> (those originating from changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation) and <i>thermodynamic changes </i> (those driven by increasing atmospheric temperatures). In this research, I am using machine learning to help answer this question. <br/><br/>I have trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify days with large-scale circulation patterns that are linked to extreme precipitation. Our research shows there has been a significant increase in the frequency of these extreme precipitation-associated circulation patterns over the past 20 years. Additionally, there have been significant increases in Midwest precipitation intensity when these circulation patterns occur. In other words, this research shows that both dynamic and thermodynamic changes have contributed to the recent increases in Midwest extreme precipitation."
