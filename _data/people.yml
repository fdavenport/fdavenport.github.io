- name: Alexandria Rodgers
  pronouns: she/her
  photo: /assets/images/profile/Rodgers.jpg
  profile: "is a PhD student co-advised by Antonio Meira Neto and Frances Davenport. Alexandria graduated from the United States Military Academy in 2014 and subsequently commissioned as an intelligence officer in the US Army. She spent the next eight years living and working abroad as a political and social analyst while also holding a role as the company's engineer for multiple construction projects across Europe. After her service, she worked for a year as a renewable energy developer with projects in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Through this work, she gained a passion for understanding the dynamic relationship between people and water. This led to her pursue a MSc in Humanitarian Engineering and Science from the Colorado School of Mines where she focused her research on community engagement around building localized knowledge for water efficient practices in small-scale agriculture. Alexandria has finally landed at CSU's CEE department to continue her research in the emerging field of sociohydrology. Alexandria's research interests include levee system risk analysis, flood policy and management, and water resource management. In her free time, you can find Alexandria volunteering, jamming at open mics around town, and out in nature enjoying all the activities Colorado has to offer!"
