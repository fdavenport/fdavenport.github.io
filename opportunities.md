##### Postdoctoral Fellow

[Prof. Pat Keys](https://sites.google.com/view/keys-research/home) and I are hiring a postdoc to start Spring 2023: 

The Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University invites applicants for a Postdoctoral Fellow position in Prof. Patrick Keysâ€™ research group. The Keys Group is a collaborative, creative and engaged community focused on exploring climate change impacts to sustainable development, investigating human dimensions of moisture recycling, and creating story-based future scenarios. The postdoc will also interact with other members of the project team, including Prof. Frances Davenport (Civil & Environmental Engineering) and Prof. Elizabeth Barnes (Atmospheric Science). 

The individual in this position will perform research in the fascinating area of how climate change interacts with sustainable development. Specifically, they will support analysis of global human impacts, using an AI algorithm that learns from Landsat satellite imagery. The position is funded by the Scott High Impact Fund, at the Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering at CSU.

For more detailed information on this position, please contact Patrick Keys at pkeys@colostate.edu or Frances Davenport at f.davenport@colostate.edu

Apply by February 15, 2023 to ensure full consideration for the position. To apply for this postdoctoral position, please go to https://jobs.colostate.edu/postings/107120


##### Graduate Students

I have funding for Masters and/or PhD students to join the Davenport Research Group starting Fall 2023 or 2024. Possible research topics could include: 

* Detecting and understanding changes in extreme precipitation events using deep learning, climate models, and historical observations
* Evaluating the predictability of climate hazards like drought, seasonal flooding, and seasonal temperature extremes on time horizons of 1 to 10 years in advance
* Investigating precipitation and temperature controls on flooding and drought/water resource availability
* Quantifying the impact of flooding and other extreme climate events on infrastructure, agriculture and other human systems

Students with a background in engineering, atmospheric or earth sciences, physics, or other related fields are especially encouraged to apply. Our research group uses computational methods, so previous experience with coding is a benefit but not a requirement. Interested students can contact Frances via email (f.davenport@colostate.edu) with a brief description of their background and interests for graduate school. 

Successful applicants will join the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Colorado State University. CEE has a strong graduate program in hydrology, with many faculty focused on water-related research. In addition, there are opportunities for coursework and/or collaborations across campus, including in the Warner College of Natural Resources, the Department of Atmospheric Science, and the College of Agricultural Sciences. 

Colorado State University is located in Fort Collins, Colorado in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Fort Collins has been ranked as one of the most livable places in the U.S.! There are many opportunities for outdoor recreation nearby, including hiking, biking (road and mountain), fishing, tubing/kayaking, and rock climbing. Denver and Boulder are about a 1 hour drive to the south, and the Denver International Airport can also be reached within a 1-hour drive.
