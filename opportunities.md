#### Graduate Students

I may have funding for additional students to join the group in Fall 2024. Students with funding through a fellowship can also apply to join the group. 

Students with a background in engineering, atmospheric or earth sciences, physics, or other related fields are especially encouraged to apply. Our research group uses computational methods, so previous experience with coding is beneficial but not a requirement. Interested students can contact Frances via email (f.davenport@colostate.edu) with a brief description of their background and interests for graduate school. 

Successful applicants will join the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Colorado State University. CEE has a strong graduate program in hydrology, with many faculty focused on water-related research. In addition, there are opportunities for coursework and/or collaborations across campus, including in the Warner College of Natural Resources, the Department of Atmospheric Science, and the College of Agricultural Sciences. 

#### Postdocs

I do not currently have funding for postdocs, but postdocs interested in joining the group can apply for external fellowships, such as the NOAA Climate and Global Change postdoctoral program or through the NSF. Interested applicants can contact Frances via email with a description of their background and interests to determine if our group would be an appropriate fit. 

#### About Fort Collins 

Colorado State University is located in Fort Collins, Colorado in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Fort Collins has been ranked as one of the most livable places in the U.S.! There are many opportunities for outdoor recreation nearby, including hiking, biking (road and mountain), fishing, tubing/kayaking, and rock climbing. Denver and Boulder are about a 1 hour drive to the south, and the Denver International Airport can also be reached within a 1-hour drive.
