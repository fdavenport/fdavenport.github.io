#### Graduate Students

I do not have currently have funding for new students to join the group. I may be able to accept students with external fellowship funding. If you are interested in applying for a fellowship with Frances as your advisor, please reach out to her via email. 

Our group is typically a good fit for students with a background in engineering, atmospheric or earth sciences, physics, or other related fields. Our research group uses computational methods, so previous experience with coding is highly beneficial. Interested students can contact Frances via email (f.davenport@colostate.edu) with a brief description of their background and interests for graduate school. 

Graduate students in the group will join the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Colorado State University. CEE has a strong graduate program in hydrology, with many faculty focused on water-related research. In addition, there are opportunities for coursework and/or collaborations across campus, including in the Warner College of Natural Resources, the Department of Atmospheric Science, and the College of Agricultural Sciences. 

#### Postdocs

I do not currently have funding for postdocs, but postdocs interested in joining the group can apply for external fellowships, such as the NOAA Climate and Global Change postdoctoral program or through the NSF. Interested applicants can contact Frances via email with a description of their background and interests to determine if our group would be an appropriate fit.
